# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PrintStruct! 🎉

We welcome all kinds of improvements - from bug fixes and formatting to new features and documentation.


## Automatic Issue Assignment

To claim an issue, simply comment on it with one of these keywords:
- `assign me`
- `assign it to me`
- `assign this to me`
- `assign this issue to me`
- `assign the issue to me`

Our automation will check:
1. **Issue availability** - The issue must not already be assigned to someone else
2. **Blocked status** - The issue must not have the `blocked` label
3. **Capacity check** - You can have at most 2 assigned issues without linked PRs

If you pass all checks, the issue will be automatically assigned to you! 🎉

**Note:** Opening a draft PR counts as having a PR linked. This allows you to claim additional issues while working on your current ones.


## Coding Guidelines

- Follow the existing Python style and structure in the project.

- Add docstrings to functions and comments where appropriate.

- If you add a new feature, include examples in the README where possible.

- Keep your PR focused on a single logical change.


## Blocked Issues Policy

Some issues depend on other work to be completed first. These are marked with:
- A `blocked` label
- A comment listing "Blocked by #..." with the blocking issue number(s)

**What happens if you try to claim a blocked issue?**

If you comment to claim a blocked issue, the automation will:
- Notify you that the issue is blocked
- Suggest up to 5 alternative unblocked issues you can work on instead

**When can you claim a blocked issue?**

Wait until all blocking issues are closed or confirmed resolved. This helps avoid wasted effort and ensures your PR can be properly reviewed.

**Tip:** Always check the issue labels and comments before claiming an issue!
